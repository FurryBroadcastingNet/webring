    "description": " In 1996 Mark Freid created a webring for the fandom to make it simple and easy to visit them, instead of getting lost in the sea of URLs that make up most search engines. In 1999 Yahoo acquired Webring.org(the orgional ring hoster) and the torch was passed on to Capt. PackRat, who was keeper from 2000-2002. In 2019 Logansryche revived the ring to restore it's main purpose: to provide a simple and easy way for Furs websites to be reached without being lost in the sea of URLs. In September Logan joined forces with Furry Broadcasting Network to further this outreach.
    
    To add your site to the ring is simple: First, make sure your site has something to do with the fandom(if you're not sure, ask), then fill out the form below and post the code on your website. No IDs or cumbersome code to fiddle with, no adds, spam, etc... The code also works on both FurAffinity and Deviantart.",
