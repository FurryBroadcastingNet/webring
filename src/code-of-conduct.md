# Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct for being apart of Fur Ring is simple.
*Your site needs to have something to do with the fandom in some way, shape or form(be it radio, art, comics, fursuits, whatever) - be it for Furs, Nekos, Bronys, Otherkins, etc.. If you're not sure, ask.
*The second rule is your site needs to be editable so you can put the Fur Ring banner on it. I believe with sites like DeviantArt and FurAffinity you can add code to your about me section so the ring banner can go in there somewhere.
*Under no circumstances will we allow linking to social media, the ring was designed to work without their pollutants.
*If you have a webcomic, we suggest using Comic Fury for hosting so you can add the banner code in there. If you have art, video, etc... we suggest finding a free webhoster(x10hosting and Wix come to mind) and create a gallery. These are suggested as not everyone is happy with the sites their currently using.
*Please only add your website to the ring(if you're not the owner, don't add it).
*If you have more then one site that's ok to add, but if you have eight sites with the same content on it, we don't allow that.
*The ring was designed to be a way to keep everyone in the fandom together, and we'd like to keep it that way. You won't find Fur Ring on any search engine. Word of mouth is the name of tha game here.
