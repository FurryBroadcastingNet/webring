# Code of Conduct

The Rules are Simple:

* Your site needs to have something to do with the fandom in some way ,shape, or form. If you're not sure, ask us.

* Your site needs to be editable so that you can add the banner code to it. If your unsure your site is editable, ask us.

* Under no circumstances will we allow linking to social media, the rung was designed to work without their pollutants.

* If you have more then one website you can add it, but if you have eight sites with the same content on it, you can not.

* Please add only your websites to the ring.


The ring was designed to be a way to keep everyone in the fandom together, and we'd like to keep it that way. You won't find Fur Ring on any search engine. Word of mouth is the name of tha game here.
