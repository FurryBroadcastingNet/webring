This is a fork of Max Boeck's Webring Starter Kit, fit for my pet project: Fur Ring: the revival of the Furry Fandom's webring.
If interested in starting your own Web Ring, please go fork Max's repo instead of this one as this is linked to https://furring.netlify.com/.


NEWS
9.1.2019 - Starting this off with my comic LUA being added to the ring.
9.2.2019 - Updated ring code to a table instead of a custom call so it matches closer to what was on the site. I'm excited to attempt to keep Mark's little project alive.
